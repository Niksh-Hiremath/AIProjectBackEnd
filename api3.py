    "happy": """It was a typical Saturday morning for Sarah - laundry, breakfast, and a bit of gardening. She had given up hope of seeing her brother, Jack, anytime soon; he was still deployed overseas, and his return was uncertain.

As she watered the plants, she heard the doorbell ring. She wiped her hands on her apron and headed to the front door, expecting it to be a neighbor or perhaps a delivery. But as she opened it, her heart skipped a beat.

There, standing on her porch with a huge smile and a bouquet of flowers, was Jack. He had managed to get leave and surprise her on her birthday.

"Jack!" Sarah exclaimed, her voice trembling with joy. She flung her arms around him, tears of happiness streaming down her face.

"Surprise! I couldn't miss your special day," Jack said, hugging her tightly. "I wanted to make it unforgettable."

As they hugged, Sarah felt a rush of love and gratitude. This was the best birthday surprise she could have ever asked for.

Together, they stepped inside, ready to celebrate and make the most of their time together. The day was filled with laughter, stories, and cherished moments that would stay with Sarah forever.

    "sad": """The doctor's face said it all. No words. Just quiet, devastating truth.

"How long?" she asked, barely breathing.

"A day. Maybe two."

She sat beside the bed. His frail fingers twitched in hers.

"Mom?" His voice - soft, scared, still hers.

"I'm here, sweetheart."

"I don't wanna go."

Tears slipped down her cheeks, landing on his hand. She forced a smile. "You're not going anywhere alone, my love. I'll be right here."

A long silence. A deep sigh. His tiny chest rising, fallingâ€”then not rising again.

A machine beeped once. Then stopped.

She pressed her lips to his forehead, rocking gently.

"Sleep now, baby. Mommy loves you."

The world shattered.""",
